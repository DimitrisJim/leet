### Problem 463 -- Island Perimeter.

Two files here for two solutions. `463_inland.py` and `463_outline.py`.

 - inland:

  Find the first patch of land and then just walk through the land counting the perimeter.
  The best this got me was around 40 percent, the *best*.

 - outline:

  I had the impression that much time was wasted walking around inland so I also made a version
  that walks around the perimeter of the land. Ironically this was just abysmal. 

All in all, there's something *very* simple here that I probably can't see yet.
