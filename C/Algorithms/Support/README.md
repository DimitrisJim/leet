## Supporting structures:

### Mapping

Superceded, leet brings in an implementation I can use. Can also be 
used as a set by setting values to `NULL` and only adding, removing,
checking for membership/size.

## Queue/Deque

Todo. Add one, will come in handy.

## List

Todo: Maybe? Could help in certain cases (e.g quick stack.)
