Ideally, should be as small as possible.

## [762. Prime Number of Set bits in binary representation.][762]

Solved but badly. There's a trick here and I can't find it, yet. I do notice there's a slight relation
between the difference and their number but can't find what. So..

## [1103. Distribute candies to people.][1103]

I can't seem to understand the problem statement correctly apparently. Even when I
build the maximally filled distribution it differs from the answer given by their
runner. 

For example, `145` should ideally fit maximally into a list of 5 elements with values:
`[23, 26, 29, 32, 35]`. Instead, when running it I get: `[34, 30, 24, 27, 30]` back.

I'm either tired or too daft to get it.

## [1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order][1389]

Can't think of a better than O(N^2) solution yet. Come back to this at 
some point.
