## [169. Majority Element][169]

Solved but `O(N)` space, this basically involves a counter, again. 

Still can't think of what trick would allow us to solve it in `O(N)` with `O(1)` space. Give it a couple of looks on other days and if you can't come up with something
add the `O(N)` time/space complexity option.

## [762. Prime Number of Set bits in binary representation.][762]

Solved but badly. There's a trick here and I can't find it, yet. I do notice there's a slight relation
between the difference and their number but can't find what. So..
